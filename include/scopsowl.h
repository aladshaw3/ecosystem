 *	\brief Simultaneously Coupled Objects for Pore and Surface diffusion Operations With Linear systems
 *	\details This file contains structures and functions associated with modeling
 *			adsorption in commercial, bi-porous adsorbents such as zeolites and 
 *			mordenites. The pore diffusion and mass transfer equations are coupled
 *			with adsorption and surface diffusion through smaller crystals embedded
 *			in a binder matrix. However, you can also direct this simulation to treat
 *			the adsorbent as homogeneous (instead of heterogeneous) in order to model
 *			an even greater variety of gaseous adsorption kinetic problems. This object
 *			is coupled with either MAGPIE, SKUA, or BOTH depending on the type of 
 *			simulation requested.

/** C-style object holding necessary information to run a SCOPSOWL simulation.
	SCOPSOWL is a multi-scale problem involving PDE solution for the macro-scale
	adsorbent pellet and the micro-scale adsorbent crystals. As such, each SCOPSOWL
	simulation involves multiple SKUA simulations at the nodes in the macro-scale
	domain. Alternatively, if the user wishes to specify that the adsorbent is
	homogeneous, then you can run SCOPSOWL as a single-scale problem. Additionally,
	you can simplfy the model by assuming that the micro-scale diffusion is very 
	fast, and therefore replace each SKUA simulation with a simpler MAGPIE evaluation. 
	Details on running SCOPSOWL with the various options will be discussed in the
	SCOPSOWL_SCENARIOS function. */
