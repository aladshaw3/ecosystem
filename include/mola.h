 *	\brief Molecule Object Library from Atoms
 *	\details This file contains a C++ Class for creating Molecule objects from the
 *			Atom objects that were defined in eel.h. Molecules can be created and
 *			registered from basic information or can be registered from a growing
 *			list of pre-registered molecules that are accessible by name/formula.
 *
 *			Registered Molecules are are known and defined prior to runtime. They
 *			have a charge, energy characteristics, phase, name, and formula that they
 *			are recongized by. The formula is used to create the atoms that they are
 *			made from. If some information is incomplete, it must be specified as to
 *			what information is missing (i.e. denote whether the formation energies are
 *			known).
 *
 *			Formation energies are used to determine stability/dissociation/acidity
 *			equilibrium constants during runtime. If the formation energies are unknown,
 *			then the equilibrium constants must be given to a reaction object on when it
 *			is initialized.
 *
 *			The molecule formula's are given as strings which are parsed in the constructor
 *			to determine what atoms from the EEL files will be registered and used. Note,
 *			you will be able to build molecules from an input file, but the library molecules
 *			here are ready to be used in applications and require no more input other that
 *			the molecule's formula.

 *			Those registered molecules follow a strict naming convention by which they

 *
 *			Naming Convention
 *			-----------------
 *			Plus (+) and minus (-) charges are denoted by the numeric value of the charge
 *			followed by a + or - sign, respectively ( e.g. UO2(CO3)3 4- (aq) )
 *
 *			The phase is always denoted last and will be marked as (l) for
 *			liquid, (s) for solid, (aq) for aqueous, and (g) for gas (see above).
 *
 *			When registering a molecule that is not in the library, you must
 *			also provide a linear formula during construction or registration.
 *			This is needed so that the string parsing is easier to handle when the
 *			molecule subsequently registers the necessary atoms. (e.g. UO2(CO3)3 =
 *			UO2C3O9 or UO11C3).
