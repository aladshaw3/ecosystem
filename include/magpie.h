 *	\brief Multicomponent Adsorption Generalized Procedure for Isothermal Equilibria
 *	\details This file contains all functions and routines associated with predicting isothermal
 *			adsorption equilibria from only single component isotherm information. The basis of
 *			the model is the Adsorbed Solution Theory developed by Myers and Prausnitz (1965). 
 *			Added to that base model is a procedure by which we can predict the non-idealities
 *			present at the surface phase by solving a closed system of equations involving
 *			the activity model. 
 *
 *			For more details on this procedure, check out our publication in AIChE where we
 *			give a fully feature explaination of our Generalized Predictive Adsorbed Solution
 *			Theory (GPAST). 
 *
 *			Reference: Ladshaw, A., Yiacoumi, S., and Tsouris, C., "A generalized procedure for
 *				the prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria", AIChE J., vol. 61, No. 8,
 *				p. 2600-2610, 2015. 
 *
 *			MAGPIE represents a special case of the more general GPAST procedure, wherin the isotherm
 *			for each species is respresent by the GSTA isotherm (see gsta_opt.h) and the activity 
 *			model for non-ideality at the adsorbent surface is a Modified Spreading Pressure Dependent
 *			(MSPD) model. See the above paper reference for more details.

/// Function to call all sub-routines to solve a MAGPIE/GPAST problem at a given temperature and pressure
/** This is the function that a typical user will want to incorporate into their own codes when evaluating
	adsorption of a gas mixture. Prior to calling this function, all required structures and information in
	the MAGPIE_DATA structure must have been properly initialized. After this function has completed it's 
	operations, it will return an integer used to denote a success or failure of the routine. Integers
	0, 1, 2, and 3 all denote success. Anything else is considered a failure. 
 
	To setup the MAGPIE_DATA structure correctly, you must reserve space for all vector objects based on the
	number of gas species in the mixture. In general, you only need to reserve space for the adsorbing species.
	However, you can also reserve space for non-adsorbing species, but you MUST give a gas/adsorbed mole fraction
	of the non-adsorbing species 0.0 so that the routine knows to ignore them (very important)! 
 
	After setting up the memory for the vector objects, you can intialize information specific to the simulation
	you want to request. The number of species (N), total pressure (PT) and gas temperature (T) must always be given.
	You can neglect the non-idealities of the surface phase by setting the Ideal bool to true. This will result in
	faster calculations, because MAGPIE will just revert down to the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST). 
 
	The Recover bool will denote whether we are doing a forward or reverse GPAST evaluation. Forward evaluation is for
	solving for the composition of the adsorbed phase given the composition of the gas phase (Recover = false). 
	Reverse evaluation is for solve for the composition of the gas phase given the composition of the adsorbed phase
	(Recover = true). 
 
	For a reverse evaluation (Recover = true) you will also need to stipulate whether or not there is a carrier gas
	(Carrier = true or false). A carrier gas is considered any non-adsorbing species that may be present in the gas
	phase and contributing to the total pressure in the system. 
 
 
	The parameters that must be initialized for all species include all GSTA_DATA parameters and the van der Waals
	volume parameter (v) in the mSPD_DATA structure. For non-adsorbing species, you can ignore these parameters, but
	need to set the sites (m) from GSTA_DATA to 1. GPAST cannot run any evaluations without these parameters being
	set properly AND set in the same order for all species (i.e., make sure that gpast_dat[i].qmax corresponds to
	mspd_dat[i].v and so on). 
 
	Lastly, you need to give either the gas phase or adsorbed phase mole fractions, depending on whether you are
	going to run a forward or reverse evaluation, respectively. For a forward evaluation, provide the gas mole
	fractions (y) in GPAST_DATA for each species (non-adsorbing species should have this value set to 0.0). For a
	reverse evaluation, provide the adsorbed mole fractions (x) in GPAST_DATA for each species, as well as the total
	adsorbed amount (qT) in SYSTEM_DATA. Again, non-adsorbing species should have their respective phase mole fractions
	set to 0.0 to exclude them from the simulation. Additionally, if there are non-adsorbing species present, then the
	Carrier bool in SYSTEM_DATA must be set to true.
