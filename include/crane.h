 *	\brief Cloud Rise After Nuclear Explosion
 *	\details This file creates objects and subroutines for solving the systems of equations for the mass,
 *			energy, and temperature of debris clouds caused by nuclear detonations. The equations solved
 *			and methods used come from the DEfense Land Fallout Interpretative Code (DELFIC) developed by
 *			U.S. DOD in the 1960s to 1970s. The original DELFIC software was written in Fortran77 and the
 *			source code is not available to the public. This software is a recreation of the Cloud Rise
 *			Module from DELFIC based on the reports made publically available. In this software, we are
 *			only interested in estimating the cloud rise and the shape of the nuclear debris cloud post-
 *			detonation of a nuclear weapon. This software does not perform any transport of the resulting
 *			fallout cloud of debris. Transport will be handled by a different code for modeling systems
 *			of PDEs. The cloud rise simulation performed here will become the initial conditions for a
 *			transport model that is to be developed later.
