 *	\brief Dynamic ODE solver with Various Established methods
 *	\details This file creates objects and subroutines for solving systems of Ordinary Differential
 *			Equations using various established methods. The basic idea is that a user will create
 *			a function to calculate all the right-hand sides of a system of ODEs, then pass that
 *			function to the DOVE routine, which will seek a numerical solution to that system.
 *
 *			Methods for Integration
 *			-----------------------
 *			BE = Backwards-Euler
 *			FE = Forwards-Euler
 *			CN = Crank-Nicholson
 *			BDF2 = Backwards-Differentiation-Formula-2
 *			RK4 = Runge-Kutta-4
 *			RKF = Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg

/// Dynamic ODE-solver with Various Established methods (DOVE) object
/** This class structure creates a C++ object that can be used to solve coupled systems of 
	Ordinary Differential Equations. A user will interface with this object by creating functions
	that evaluate the right-hand side of an ODE based on the given variable set. Those functions
	will collectively create the system to solve numerically using either explicit or implicit 
	methods. The choice of methods can be set by the user, or the object will default to the
	Backwards-Euler implicit method for stability. 
 
	User functions for the right-hand side are written as...
 
	du_i/dt = user_function_i(const Matrix<double> &u, const void *data_struct)
 
	In some cases, there is a need to include a time coefficient on the left-hand side of the rate
	expression. For those cases, the user may also provide a time coefficient function...
 
	user_time_coeff_i(const Matrix<double> &u, const void *data_struct) * du_i/dt = user_function_i(...)
 
	For most implicit problems, the ODE system must be solved iteratively using a Newton-style method. In 
	these cases, the user may also provide functions for Jacobian matrix elements...
	
	user_jacobi_element_i_j(const Matrix<double> &u, const void *data_struct)
 
	All of these above functions are to be put into Matrices inside of the Dove class object so that Dove
	will call those functions when it needs to be called. Data structures for all function calls are optional
	and are to be defined by the user to contain whatever parameter information is needed for their particular
	problem. */
