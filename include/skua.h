 *	\brief Surface Kinetics for Uptake by Adsorption
 *	\details This file contains structures and functions associated with solving the surface diffusion
 *			partial differential equations for adsorption kinetics in spherical and/or cylindrical
 *			adsorbents. For this system, it is assumed that the pore size is so small that all molecules
 *			are confined to movement exclusively on the surface area of the adsorbent. The total amount
 *			of adsorption for each species is drive by the MAGPIE model for non-ideal mixed gas adsorption.
 *			Spatial and temporal varience in adsorption is caused by a combination of different kinetics
 *			between adsorbing species and different adsorption affinities for the surface. 
 *
 *			The function for surface diffusion involves four parameters, although not all of these parameters
 *			are required to be used. Surface diffusion theoretically varies with temperature according to the
 *			Arrhenius rate expression, but we also add in an empirical correction term to account for variations
 *			in diffusivity with the partial pressure of the species in the gas phase. \n
 *
 *			D_surf = D_ref * exp(-E / (R*T) ) * pow(p , (T_ref/T) - B ) \n
 *
 *			D_ref is the Reference Diffusivity (um^2/hr), E is the activation energy for adsorption
 *			(J/mol), R is the gas law constant (J/K/mol), T is the system temperature (K), p is the
 *			partial pressure of the adsorbing species (kPa), T_ref is the Reference Temperature (K), and
 *			B is the Affinity constant. \n
