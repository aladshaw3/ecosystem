         ADVANCED USER INTERFACE (AUI)         
-----------------------------------------------

Usage: eco [ --run_option {opt_name} ] [ --add_option {variables} ]

run_option
----------
-v, --version : prints out version information for the program
-h, --help    : prints out the help information for the program
-t, --test    : tells the program that you have requested to run a test (see below for available test names)
-e, --execute : tells the program that you have requested to run an executable (see below for available exe names)

opt_name
--------
Designates the type of test or executable to run. List of available test and executable names below. NOT CASE SENSITIVE

add_option
----------
-p, --path    : designate the path to a series of input files, if all those files share a common path
-i, --input   : designate the path, name, and extension for an input file to a particular executable

variables
---------
The actual option values, i.e., path and/or input files necessary to run the specific executable

Usage Examples
--------------
eco -t lark

	Directs the program to run the LARK tests for the linear algebra library

eco --version

	Directs the program to print out the version information for the software

eco --execute gsta_opt -i input/data.txt

	Directs the program to run the GSTA optimization routine on a set of data located in a sub-directory called input in the file named data.txt

eco -e scopsowl -p path/to/input/ --input scene.txt sorbent.txt comp.txt sorbate.txt

	Directs the program to run a SCOPSOWL simulation given a series of input files all located in the common path denoted by path/to/input/ with the names and extenstions of the files given after the -i flag

Usage Notes
--------------
(i) All input files must be given in the order expected and must include paths and extensions
(ii) All paths must be given relative to the directory from which the program is being called
(iii) Most common usage errors are caused by mistakes in input file order or within the structure of the input files themselves
